Description: A set of objects and functions for Bayes Linear emulation and history matching.
  Core functionality includes automated training of emulators to data, diagnostic functions
  to ensure suitability, and a variety of proposal methods for generating 'waves' of points.
  For details on the mathematical background, there are many papers available on the topic
  (see references attached to function help files); for details of the functions in this package,
  consult the manual or help files.
